### Advertising Push Letter 1: New Members & Feedback

*In the [Planning Events](http://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroupHandbook/running.html#planning) section of the Handbook, we talked about splitting the year up into logical pieces for your community (semesters, terms or quarters), and doing a big advertising push at the beginning of each. Here's a template for an email to send out as widely as possible in your community; remember to get the other people helping you run your Study Group to push this out to their networks, too, to reach as many different people as possible. This is also your chance to collect input from your community on what they're interested in; one easy way to do this is by making a [google form here](https://www.google.com/forms/about/). Check out this example survey from the [SFU Scientific Programming Study Group](http://goo.gl/forms/OXNe5kB8ao), and thanks to that same group for the first draft of the template below!*

*About a week after this mail goes out, send one more reminder, encouraging people to lead sessions; see a template for that mail [here](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupHandbook/blob/gh-pages/templates/startOfTermLetter2.md).*

Variables:

 - LOCATION: where your Study Group is - city, institution or otherwise.
 - LINK: the link to your main Study Group webpage listing your events.
 - SURVEY LINK: link to your input survey
 - THE ORGANIZERS: the names of all the Study Group organizers for your local group.

Greetings,

There is a new Study Group at LOCATION for scientists, researchers and students to get together, share programming and research skills, explore open science techniques for doing more visible & reproducible research, and help each other out with the technical challenges we meet every day. I think we could all learn a lot and make some new connections by working together on this. 

Most study sessions will consist of an hour-long tutorial, where one member of our community will demonstrate a tool, package or some other useful skill, be it coding, data management, scientific communication or otherwise. We have a website listing the first few sessions we're planning: LINK

If you're interested, please take the super short survey below. We are committed to reflecting what the community wants, so please be vocal!

Take survey here: SURVEY LINK

Sincerely, 
THE ORGANIZERS
