### Intro mail

*When your study group is just starting out, you'll need to let everyone know what's going on, while simultaneously encouraging people to step up to help organize, teach and get involved. Try remixing this template for your group (remember to fill out all the VARIABLES), and distribute it widely - departmental mailing lists, student groups and others. Also, there's a survey designed to get a sense of what people are interested in; try setting this up as a [Google form](https://www.google.com/forms/about/), and distributing with your mail. Also see an [example survey](http://goo.gl/forms/OXNe5kB8ao) from the SFU Scientific Computing Study Group.*

Variables:

 - INSTITUTION: where you'll be hosting most of your events.
 - UNIVERSITY PUB OR CAFE: where you'll have your planning meetup to chat with people who are interested.
 - DATE AND TIME: of your planning meetup.
 - ISSUE TRACKER: link to the issue tracker in your Study Group GitHub repo.
 - THIS SURVEY: link to the survey described below (optional)
 - GITHUB REPO: link to the front page of your Study Group GitHub repo.

Hi all,

I wanted to let you know about the new coding Study Group we're starting at INSTITUTION soon; the Mozilla Science Lab has started a series of meetup groups for scientists and researchers to get together, share computing skills, and help each other out with the programming and data management nearly all of us have to do as part of our research. I think we could all learn a lot and make some new connections by working together on this.

Most Study Group sessions are about an hour long tutorial, where one person from our community leads a hands-on demonstration of an idea, package or piece of code, while everyone else follows along; also, we'll get together once in a while for open co-working sessions to work on our own research projects and get help with questions as they arise. The tutorial sessions are lead by volunteers, and the curriculum and schedule is up to us to set; what I'd like to do first, is get together to find out what everyone is interested in learning and doing.

Shall we meet up at UNIVERSITY PUB OR CAFE to discuss on DATE AND TIME? Everyone is welcome - Study Groups work best when they reflect what the community wants, so come out and let us know. If you can't make it out but have ideas or questions, please post a thread on our [ISSUE TRACKER](). Also, if you could take a second to fill out [THIS SURVEY]() to let us know what you'd be interested in, that would be a big help, too. Finally, if you'd like updates on what our Study Group is doing, watch our repository by clicking 'Watch' at the top of our [GITHUB REPO](). Thanks in advance!
